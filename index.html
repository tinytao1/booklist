       Ch 1 <br> <br>
       
The tao that can be told <br>
is not the eternal Tao <br>
The name that can be named <br>
is not the eternal Name. <br> <br>

The unnamable is the eternally real. <br>
Naming is the origin <br>
of all particular things. <br> <br>

Free from desire, you realize the mystery. <br>
Caught in desire, you see only the manifestations. <br> <br>

Yet mystery and manifestations <br>
arise from the same source. <br>
This source is called darkness. <br> <br>

Darkness within darkness. <br>
The gateway to all understanding.  <br> <br> <br>

Ch 2 <br> <br>

When people see some things as beautiful, <br>
other things become ugly. <br>
When people see some things as good, <br>
other things become bad. <br> <br>

Being and non-being create each other. <br>
Difficult and easy support each other. <br>
Long and short define each other. <br>
High and low depend on each other. <br>
Before and after follow each other. <br> <br>

Therefore the Master <br>
acts without doing anything <br>
and teaches without saying anything. <br>
Things arise and she lets them come; <br>
things disappear and she lets them go. <br>
She has but doesn't possess, <br>
acts but doesn't expect. <br>
When her work is done, she forgets it. <br>
That is why it lasts forever.  <br> <br> <br>

CH 5 <br> <br>

The Tao doesn't take sides; <br>
it gives birth to both good and evil. <br>
The Master doesn't take sides; <br>
she welcomes both saints and sinners. <br> <br>

The Tao is like a bellows: <br>
it is empty yet infinitely capable. <br>
The more you use it, the more it produces; <br>
the more you talk of it, the less you understand. <br> <br>

Hold on to the center.  <br> <br>

CH 8 <br> <br>

The supreme good is like water, <br>
which nourishes all things without trying to. <br>
It is content with the low places that people disdain. <br>
Thus it is like the Tao. <br> <br>

In dwelling, live close to the ground. <br>
In thinking, keep to the simple. <br>
In conflict, be fair and generous. <br>
In governing, don't try to control. <br>
In work, do what you enjoy. <br>
In family life, be completely present. <br> <br>

When you are content to be simply yourself <br>
and don't compare or compete, <br>
everybody will respect you.  <br>

	   &nbsp; The Tao Te Ching is partly in prose, partly in verse; but as we define poetry
now, not by rhyme and meter but as a patterned intensity of language, the whole
thing is poetry. I wanted to catch that poetry, its terse, strange beauty. Most
translations have caught meanings in their net, but prosily, letting the beauty
slip through. And in poetry, beauty is no ornament; it is the meaning. It is the
truth. We have that on good authority. <br> 
	     &nbsp;  It is the most lovable of all the great religious texts, funny, keen, kind,
modest, indestructibly outrageous, and inexhaustibly refreshing. Of all the deep
springs, this is the purest water. To me, it is also the deepest spring. <br>
	&nbsp; Commentaries at the foot of some of the chapters are my own responses to the
text. They are idiosyncratic and unscholarly, and are to be ignored if not found
helpful. <br>  <br>  <br> 

	      
       Ch 1. &nbsp; Taoing <br> <br>

The way you can go <br>
isn’t the real way. <br>
The name you can say <br>
isn’t the real name. <br> <br>

Heaven and earth <br>
begin in the unnamed: <br>
name’s the mother <br>
of the ten thousand things. <br> <br>

So the unwanting soul <br>
sees what’s hidden, <br>
and the ever-wanting soul <br>
sees only what it wants. <br> <br>

Two things, one origin, <br>
but different in name, <br>
whose identity is mystery. <br>
Mystery of all mysteries! <br>
The door to the hidden. <br> 
	      <hr>
	      A satisfactory translation of this chapter is, I believe, perfectly impossible. It
contains the book. <br> <br> <br>

	      
Ch 2. &nbsp; Soul food <br> <br>

Everybody on earth knowing <br>
that beauty is beautiful <br>
makes ugliness. <br> <br>

Everybody knowing <br>
that goodness is good <br>
makes wickedness. <br> <br>

For being and nonbeing <br>
arise together; <br>
hard and easy <br>
complete each other; <br>
long and short <br>
shape each other; <br>
high and low <br>
depend on each other; <br>
note and voice <br>
make the music together; <br>
before and after <br>
follow each other. <br> <br>

That’s why the wise soul <br>
does without doing, <br>
teaches without talking. <br> <br>

The things of this world <br>
exist, they are; <br>
you can’t refuse them. <br> <br>

To bear and not to own; <br>
to act and not lay claim; <br>
to do the work and let it go: <br>
for just letting it go <br>
is what makes it stay. <br> 
	      <hr>
	      One of the things I read in this chapter is that values and beliefs are not only
culturally constructed but also part of the interplay of yin and yang, the great
reversals that maintain the living balance of the world. To believe that our
beliefs are permanent truths which encompass reality is a sad arrogance. To let
go of that belief is to find safety.<br> <br> <br>

	      
	Ch. 5 &nbsp; Useful emptiness <br> <br>

Heaven and earth aren’t humane. <br>
To them the ten thousand things <br>
are straw dogs. <br> <br>
	      
Wise souls aren’t humane. <br>
To them the hundred families <br>
are straw dogs. <br> <br>
	      
Heaven and earth <br>
act as a bellows: <br> <br>
	      
Empty yet structured, <br>
it moves, inexhaustibly giving. <br> <br> <br>
	      

	  Ch 8. &nbsp; Easy by nature <br> <br>

True goodness <br>
is like water. <br>
Water’s good <br>
for everything. <br>
It doesn’t compete. <br> <br>
	      
It goes right <br>
to the low loathsome places, <br>
and so finds the way. <br> <br>
	      
For a house, <br>
the good thing is level ground. <br>
In thinking, <br>
depth is good. <br>
The good of giving is magnanimity; <br>
of speaking, honesty; <br>
of government, order. <br>
The good of work is skill, <br>
and of action, timing. <br> <br>
	      
No competition, <br>
so no blame. <br> <br>
